##Installing
I don't have to explain this, do I? But let me just say that you need a folder called 'tmp' in the same folder where the login.php is

###PHP
```php

// Setup the connections and instances.
$client     = new Guzzle\Http\Client('', ['redirect.disable' => true]);
$connection = new Gumer\PSN\Http\Connection;
$connection->setGuzzle($client);
$provider   = new Gumer\PSN\Authentication\UserProvider($connection);
$auth       = Gumer\PSN\Authentication\Manager::instance($provider);

// Attempt to login.
$auth->attempt('username_here', 'password_here');


// Get the current user profile.
$request    = new Gumer\PSN\Requests\GetMyInfoRequest;
$response   = $connection->call($request);
$info       = json_decode($response->getBody(true), true);

// Get the friends list for the current 
$request    = new Gumer\PSN\Requests\TrophyDataRequest;
$request->setUserId($info['onlineId']);
$response   = $connection->call($request);
```


and so on..

NOTE:
	I do own a PlayStation 3 system, so i can spam my friends with messages and check if they are online.
	I downloaded the PSN app on my iPhone 5 and the apps are similar. I can sniff the data which are sent to PlayStation servers, so I was able to create the code to send messages.
	You can donate to ilendemli@live.at, if you want to support me and my work. Any support is appreciated!
